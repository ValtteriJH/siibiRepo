        <h2>How does the page update?</h2>
                <p>The data source is a self made API on the school restaurant. It takes a bit of processing so the site updates every 15s, and now actually updates without refreshing the page. (V1.2)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>How long will the page be up?</h2>
        <p>FOREVER BABY (I'll host it until my graduation, but I'll make this someone else's problem before that)</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>iS mY dAtA In DanGer, cAn I trUst YoU?</h2>
        <p>I think I'm the only nerd who asked this but: No, but I can't do much harm with the site. I'll get all the code out in the open when I get to it, and link it here. For now you can see all the client side code with inspect element, and looking through the code. Its as simple as it gets. I just want this problem solved, and I hope it helps others too.</p>
